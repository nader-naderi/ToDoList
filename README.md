# ToDoList

Welcome to the ToDoList project! This is a simple project for managing your tasks and to-dos.

## Project Architecture

This project follows a simplified N-Layer architecture for better organization and maintainability. The key layers include:

1. **Presentation Layer**:
   - Responsible for user interaction and user interface components.
   - Includes web pages, forms, and user interfaces.
   - Communicates with the business logic layer to request and display data.

2. **Business Logic Layer**:
   - Contains the core application logic and rules.
   - Processes requests from the presentation layer.
   - Manages data processing, calculations, and business rules.

3. **Data Access Layer**:
   - Handles data storage and retrieval.
   - Communicates with the database or data storage system.
   - Performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

4. **Database Layer** (Optional):
   - Represents the physical database system.
   - Stores and manages data using a relational database management system (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL).

## TODO

Here is a list of tasks and improvements that need to be addressed in the project:

- **Apply Testing for Services and Repositories**: Implement unit and integration tests for the services and repositories to ensure the reliability and correctness of your application.

- **Add Logger**: Integrate a logging system to keep track of important events and errors within the application. This will help with debugging and monitoring.

- **Implement Tier-3 Layer Architecture**: Refactor the application to follow a Tier-3 (or three-tier) architecture, separating presentation, business logic, and data access layers for improved maintainability and scalability.

- **Add Authentication and Authorization**: Enhance the security of the application by implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms to control user access and protect sensitive data.

- **Enhance User Interface**: Improve the user interface to provide a better user experience, including responsive design and accessibility features.

- **Implement Task Categories**: Allow users to categorize tasks, making it easier to organize and prioritize their to-dos.

- **Add Notifications**: Implement notifications or reminders to alert users about upcoming tasks or deadlines.

Feel free to contribute and tackle these tasks to make ToDoList even better!
